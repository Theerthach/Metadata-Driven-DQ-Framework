# Metadatad-Driven-DQ-Framework
## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **metadata-driven data quality testing framework** designed to integrate seamlessly with **CI/CD pipelines**.  
It validates **schema integrity and business rules** on structured datasets and blocks bad data before it reaches downstream systems.

The project simulates **real-world enterprise data quality gating** used in modern data engineering teams.
